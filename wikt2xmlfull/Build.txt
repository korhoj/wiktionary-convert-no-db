Download and install Eclipse 2022-09 and OpenJDK 19.

Right click StripNamespaces.java > Run As > Java Applications
  Eclipse runs the program, which outputs in the Console tab, that it got 0 arguments and it quits
Right click StripNamespaces.java > Run As > Run Configurations
  Java Application > StripNamespaces should be selected automatically. If not, select it
Right click StripNamespaces.java > Export > Java > Runnable JAR file
  Launch configuration = StripNamespaces - wikt2xmlfull
  Export destination: Choose path where you want to keep the runnable JAR
  [x] Package required libraries into generated JAR
Perform the Run As and Export steps also for ReadStripped.java
The two runnable JARs really only differ in the Rsrc-Main-Class in META-INF\MANIFEST.MF

Running tests in Eclipse

For running Wiktionary conversion tests in Eclipse, you need to create a run (or debug) configuration. They
unfortunately can't easily be shared in Git.

To define a test for e.g. ReadStripped.java (can also be done for StripNamespaces.java), right click
 ReadStripped.java > Run As > Run Configurations.
Select Java Application and press the New Launch Configuration icon.
Enter a Name for the configuration.

1) Test for the English Wiktionary, processing all languages.
Input in examples/apples.txt

Right click ReadStripped.java > Run As > Run Configurations
Select Java Application and press the New Launch Configuration icon
Enter a Name for the configuration, e.g.: ReadStripped apples.txt ALL languages test
The arguments are given in this order:
  INFILE OUTFILE LANG OUTPUTLANGNAMES OUTTYPE RESTARTATLINE LANGCODE ONLYLANGUAGES WIKTCODE
Enter into the Arguments tab e.g.:
  examples\apples.txt examples\out\apples-out.txt ALL true Stardict 0 en true en
Or e.g. with full folder path for the output file:
  examples/apples.txt G:\Dropbox\Dictionary\wikt\Stardict\OwnStarDict\wikt-en-ALL-debug.txt ALL true Stardict 0 en true en
To run the test, press Run (or Debug)
Refresh the workspace. Open examples\out\apples-out.txt. It should contain:

apples and pears	n.\n(context Cockney rhyming slang English) stairs

2) Test for the English Wiktionary, processing definitions in English only.
Input in examples/apples.txt

Enter a Name for the configuration, e.g.: ReadStripped apples.txt English only test
Enter into the Arguments tab:
  examples\apples.txt examples\out\apples-out-en.txt en true Stardict 0 en true en
Press Run
Refresh the workspace. Open examples\out\apples-out.txt. It should contain the same than the previous test.

See Running.txt for instructions on running the JARs via dedicated Win batch scripts,
e.g. "ReadStripped SD en-ALL.cmd". Running that way does not use Eclipse, just the JDK.
For producing real builds it's probably clearest to use the scripts, not Eclipse. At least it requires less RAM.
If you want, you can of course also run tests outside of Ecipse, but I haven't written batch scripts for that.
